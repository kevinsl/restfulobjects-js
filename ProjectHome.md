This single-page javascript application consumes the json api described at http://restfulobjects.org and implemented
by Apache isis (http://incubator.apache.org/isis/) and Naked Objects (http://nakedobjects.codeplex.com).

Getting started: copy index.jsp and the css, js and lib directories to the viewer-json/src/main/webapp directory of your Apache Isis project. Open index.jsp in a browser and see the naked objects magic unfold... (Currently only tested in Chrome.)
